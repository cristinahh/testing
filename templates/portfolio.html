      I have 10+ years of experience in the workforce mainly in Customer
      Service. I have worked with a variety of companies, before I continued my
      education at California State University, Fullerton. I started as a
      cashier and steadily grew my skills as I transitioned into Administration.
      Today, I work for a small company handling all of their billing and
      scheduling, proving my exceptional attention to detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      My time at CSUF has been nothing but amazing and I have learned so many
      new skills and interacted with a variety of students and professors. I
      have worked on projects on my own as well as in teams where I have taken
      the role of both a supporting member as well as a leader in the group. I
      am most proud of my work as a leader in my cyber security class, where I
      have been able to keep the entire team on task as well as provide support
      on areas as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am looking for a role as a Computer Science Intern where I can leverage
      all the skills I have aquired from my past experiences in order to succeed
      and continure to grow within a company. I would love to work for a company
      that shares the same values as I do, which is, good work is done with
      <em>focus</em>, great work is done with <strong>grit</strong>.
